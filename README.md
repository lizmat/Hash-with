NAME
====

Hash-with - Roles for automatically mapping keys in hashes

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Hash-with;

my %h1 does Hash-lc = A => 42;             # map all keys to lowercase
say %h1<a>;    # 42

my %h2 does Hash-uc = a => 42;             # map all keys to uppercase
say %h2<A>;    # 42

sub ordered($a) { $a.comb.sort.join }
my %h3 does Hash-with[&ordered] = oof => 42;  # sort characters of key
say %h3<foo>;  # 42
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Hash::with provides several `role`s that can be mixed in with a `Hash`.

Hash-lc
-------

The role that will convert all keys of a hash to their **lowercase** equivalent before being used to access the hash.

```raku
my %h1 does Hash-lc = A => 42;             # map all keys to lowercase
say %h1<a>;    # 42
```

This is in fact an optimized version of `does Hash-with[&lc]`.

Hash-uc
-------

The role that will convert all keys of a hash to their **uppercase** equivalent before being used to access the hash.

```raku
my %h2 does Hash-uc = a => 42;             # map all keys to uppercase
say %h2<A>;    # 42
```

This is in fact an optimized version of `does Hash-with[&uc]`.

Hash-with
---------

The role that will convert all keys of a hash according to a `mapper` function before being used to access the hash.

```raku
sub ordered($a) { $a.comb.sort.join }
my %h3 does Hash-with[&ordered] = oof => 42;  # order all keys
say %h3<foo>;  # 42
```
